Hey there!


I'm a senior data scientist with over 16 years of experience under my belt. I've got a strong background in software engineering and I've delivered some great work over the years - on time and to a high standard. I've worked on a variety of ML projects, from researching papers to implementing solutions and making sure they're robust enough to be used in the real world. I've also worked on tools for making models more explainable and fair.


I've had the opportunity to work with over 30 clients, on a whole range of different projects. I've tackled machine learning, data engineering, web development, and more. I've led teams and contributed back to open source projects, with some of my own libraries hosted on GitHub.


As a kid, I played on a soccer team and it taught me the importance of always pushing to be better. That lesson has stayed with me and I've never stopped learning and trying to improve.


I'm not afraid to take on big challenges. I started my own software consultancy years ago and it's helped me understand the needs and struggles of my clients better.


I'm passionate about diving deep into subjects and data science is a perfect example. The more I learn, the more I want to know.


Outside of work, I value having a healthy work-life balance. I make time for my daughter, wife, and friends. I also enjoy hobbies like cycling, calisthenics, home-brewing, and reading graphic novels. It's important for me to have balance in my life in order to perform well both in my work and personal life.
